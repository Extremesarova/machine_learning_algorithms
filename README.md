## Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
The sole purpose of this repository is to understand the concepts of machine learning algorithms - how they work under their hood.  
The code was not designed to be used by someone else (poorly documented, has no unit tests) - it is just an investigational-purposed code.  
Working through these algorithms helps me understand the idea behind them. Also, these materials are helpful to me when I want to remember particular points of implementation and the algorithm, in general.  
Based on this knowledge, I'm mastering concepts behind the more advanced architectures, like gradient boosting, neural networks and so on.
