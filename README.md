# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

The sole purpose of this repository is to understand the concepts of machine learning algorithms - how they work under their hood.  

The code was not designed to be used in production (poorly documented, has no unit tests) - for that we have Scikit-learn and other optimized ML frameworks.

## TO DO

- Add implementation with examples for the next algorithms:
  - Linear regression using SGD with regularization
  - Linear regression using formula through SVD
  - Logistic regression using SGD with regularization with logistic loss (labels 0/1)
  - Logistic regression using SGD with regularization (labels -1/1)
  - word2vec implementation with SGD optimization and the choice of training method (naive softmax, negative sampling)
  - Decision Tree implementation for regression and classification
